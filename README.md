# quiz_game
This is a quiz game for kids, worked on this during my tutorial on the basics of python.
This program was written in such a way that the questions and options are shuffled everytime a user wants to attempt the quiz again. During the quiz, it gets the time a user starts and finishes the quiz, and outputs the time the user has spent attempting the test.
